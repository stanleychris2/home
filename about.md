Hi, my name is Chris Stanley. I live in Los Angeles and am currently a data science freelancer. I graduated from Yale University in 2011 where I double majored in Economics and Psychology and played on the Varsity Football and Track and Field teams. I worked for Nomura Securities from 2011 to 2014 in macro rates sales where I focused most of my time pricing and selling US interest rate derivatives. 

In 2014 I was the non-technical founder of [FurnishUp](http://www.furnishup.com/), an online 3D design platform that allows anyone to design the interior of his or her home with furniture and decor. FurnishUp is now an open source project under the name [Blueprint3D](https://github.com/furnishup/blueprint3d). 

I’m interested in a lot of things, including and in no particular order psychology, eonomics (and their intersection, behavioral economics), finance, markets, user experiences, design, startups, bootstrapping, software development, data analysis, [filmmaking](https://vimeo.com/user16553597), storytelling… oh and [climbing mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45giRi5F3Ng).
