With experience in finance and startups and a fascination with design and psychology, I'm currently looking for an associate product manager role at a growth stage company that has a strong data science culture. 

## What I'm currently doing:
- Data Science
	- I'm currently putting myself through an intensive data science curriculum. I am a strong believer in leveraging data science to inform business and product decisions. I have experience with advanced statistical models from working in finance, and am expanding that skillset to tools/techniques more applicable to business/product analysis: Python, pandas, PostgreSQL, web scraping, regression, A/B testing, classification, similarity matching, clustering. This is the [curriculum](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html) I am following. 
	- Am in the beginning stages of building business intelligence tools and automatically generated market reports for [Graypools](http://www.graypools.com). 

- Crowdsourced design thinking: ProjectEvolve Listserve
	- The Listserve is an e-mail lottery where one person a day wins a chance to write to 25k+ people. I won, and decided to lead a crowdsourced design thinking exercise with 200+ other people to improve The Listserve. We’re currently in the research phase and will soon be breaking into groups to brainstorm and define problem statements. The project website is [here.](http://project-evolve-listserve.github.io/home)
