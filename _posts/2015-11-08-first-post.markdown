Welp… here we go!

For too long I have delayed the process of constructing thoughtful commentary for others to read via a blog. In college I created a Tumblr named something like the “Irrationality of Happiness” (does that even make sense?) because I drank wayyy to much caffeine when writing my psychology thesis and needed an avenue to express what felt like the ability to read minds. I wrote one post which I can’t even find anymore. Why didn’t I continue? **I had just landed a job and thought more harm than good would come from blogging about my ideas.** We’re not even talking about radical ideas - it just felt that anything not directly constructive for the job created unnecessary exposure. Psychology can be pretty provocative.

The next urge I had to blog was a couple years into my first job and I wanted to change careers. I wanted to blog in order to convince others that that although I have zero work experience in startups or technology I am capable of much more and they should hire me. After nearly a month of drafting, I realized I was writing original ‘fluff’ and regurgitating opinions to decorate my online presence. Although in theory I agreed with the “lean startup” methodology and had adopted technology market opinions - I still thought that HTML was a programming language and in fact had zero practical experience. **My mind hadn’t spent nearly enough time thinking about entrepreneurship - at that point blogging just didn’t feel right.**

Blogging is difficult. Speaking to a potentially unlimited audience (because that is the point of these things, right?) is frightening. What if I say things that people don’t like? What if I missed something in my research? What if I’m just restating something others have already nailed home? Well… I guess you have to anticipate that those thing are probably going to happen, and embrace them. What’s different this time? **I’ve realized, I only stand to benefit should I communicate my ideas. I think if you blog with the intent to provide value to others, you stand to gain a lot from the conversation that follows.**

I’ve always wanted to “map my mind” to see if the exercise gives me any insight into my ideas, thoughts, or interests. Individually, mind mapping is a useful exercise, but collectively through a blog - I think you stand to gain much more. Ideas are meant to be shared, they’re contagious by design, some become viral - if you think your ideas are interesting and others may find them useful - let it rip. You’ll never know what happens if you don’t :).
