### 2014 Energy Star Score 

The Existing Commercial Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance (Environment Code Chapter 20) requires that each non-residential building with at least 10,000 square feet of conditioned (heated or cooled) space must be benchmarked using Energy Star Portfolio Manager annually, and undergo an energy audit or retrocommissioning at least once every 5 years. A link to the dataset is [here.](https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/Existing-Commercial-Buildings-Energy-Performance-O/j2j3-acqj)

Below is a very simple Choropleth visualization of the mean 2014 Energy Star Score for each zipcode in San Francisco. It was created using [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/). IPython notebook to organize data is [here.](https://github.com/stanleychris2/graph-a-day/blob/master/2:7:16%20-%202014%20San%20Francisco%20Energy%20Score%20by%20Zip.ipynb)
