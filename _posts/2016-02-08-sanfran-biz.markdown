### Number of Businesses by Zipcode in San Francisco 

Registered business locations in San Francisco maintained by the Office of Treasurer-Tax Collector, including business locations that have been sold, closed, or moved out of San Francisco. A link to the dataset is [here.](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Registered-Business-Locations-San-Francisco/g8m3-pdis)


Below is a very simple Choropleth visualization of the number of business in the dataset per zipcode. It does not isolate for sold/closed/or moved. That would be a useful extension. It was created using [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/). IPython notebook to organize data is [here.](https://github.com/stanleychris2/graph-a-day/blob/master/2-8-16-sf_biz.ipynb)
